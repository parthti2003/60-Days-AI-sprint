# 60 Days AI Sprint

Welcome to my **60 Days AI Sprint**! This repository documents my dedicated journey to mastering Artificial Intelligence (AI) and landing my first AI engineering role. Over the course of 60 days, I will build a strong foundation in AI, work on real-world projects, solve coding challenges, and improve my overall problem-solving skills.

## Objective

The goal of this sprint is to:

- **Master Python** as a primary language for AI.
- Learn **core AI concepts** such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.
- **Build impactful AI projects** that will serve as a portfolio to demonstrate my capabilities.
- Practice solving coding challenges regularly to prepare for technical interviews.
- Stay consistent with daily learning and continuous improvement to land my first AI engineering job.

## What Iâ€™m Focusing On

### 1. **Core Programming Concepts**  
- Python fundamentals (data types, control flow, functions)
- Data structures & algorithms to improve problem-solving abilities

### 2. **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**  
- Building models and algorithms to solve real-world problems
- Understanding the latest trends in AI and deep learning techniques

### 3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
- Exploring NLP techniques to work with textual data
- Hands-on projects using popular libraries like SpaCy and Hugging Face

### 4. **AI Project Development**  
- Developing projects that demonstrate my AI expertise
- Projects to be added to this repository to showcase my learning and growth

### 5. **LeetCode and Coding Challenges**  
- Solving problems to enhance coding skills and prepare for technical interviews

## Milestones

- **Days 1-30:** Focus on mastering Python and core AI concepts, including data structures, algorithms, and machine learning fundamentals.
- **Days 31-60:** Dive deep into advanced machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and project development. Start building portfolio-worthy projects.

## Key Goals

By the end of this 60-day sprint, I aim to:

1. Have a **comprehensive understanding** of Python, AI, and machine learning techniques.
2. Complete multiple **AI-driven projects** to showcase my skills.
3. Have a **polished GitHub portfolio** to demonstrate my capabilities.
4. Be fully prepared for AI engineering job interviews with a solid understanding of the technologies and problem-solving techniques needed.

## Progress Updates

I will regularly commit code, share project updates, and document my learning experiences through this repository. Follow my journey, and feel free to explore the projects and coding challenges I work on. Updates will also be shared on my LinkedIn for broader visibility.
