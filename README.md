60 Days AI Sprint
Welcome to my 60-day AI learning journey! This repository showcases my path to mastering essential AI skills and landing my first AI engineering job. Over the next two months, I will work through a structured learning plan covering Python, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and other critical topics in AI. Along the way, I will create projects, solve coding challenges, and improve my skills to become a job-ready AI engineer.

What’s Inside
Python Basics: Learning the fundamentals, including syntax, data types, and control flow.

Data Structures & Algorithms: Solving problems and improving problem-solving skills.

Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Hands-on projects and coding exercises.

AI Projects: Building practical AI solutions to showcase my skills.

LeetCode Challenges: Consistent practice to improve coding abilities and prepare for technical interviews.

Milestones
Days 1-30: Focus on mastering the core AI and programming concepts (Python, Data Structures, Algorithms, and introductory Machine Learning).

Days 31-60: Dive deeper into machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and AI deployment. Build advanced projects and prepare for job applications.

Goal
The goal is to be proficient in AI and ready for job interviews in 60 days, showcasing a strong portfolio on GitHub. I’m committed to consistent learning, hands-on projects, and solving real-world problems through AI technologies.
